## üöÄ Getting Started

To set up and run this project on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or Yarn) installed:
- **Node.js (LTS)**
- **npm (comes with Node.js)** or **Yarn**

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sightser/sightser.github.io.git
cd sightser.github.io
```

Install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Development

To start the local development server and view the portfolio in your browser:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will typically open your project at http://localhost:5173 (or another available port). Changes made to the source code will hot-reload automatically.

### Building for Production

To compile and optimize the project for deployment:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This will create a `dist/` directory containing the minified and optimized production assets.

### Deployment to GitHub Pages

This project is configured for seamless deployment to GitHub Pages.

#### Verify vite.config.js base:

For a User/Organization Page (e.g., sightser.github.io), ensure `base: '/'` is set in `vite.config.js`.  
(Your current vite.config.js is set to `base: '/'`, which is correct for a user page.)

Run the deploy script:

```bash
npm run deploy
# or
yarn deploy
```

This command will build your project and push the contents of the `dist` directory to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository, making your portfolio live.
